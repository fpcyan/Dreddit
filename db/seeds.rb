# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# User.destroy_all
# Subs.destroy_all
# Posts.destroy_all

# 5.times do |i|
#   Post.create!(title:"#{i.ordinalize} post", content:"#{i}", sub_id: 1, author_id: 8)
# end
